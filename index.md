### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was an expansion/upgrade
    to the previous Hi-Lo lab. It was cool to be able to see how to properly
    format loops and see how easy it is to improve old code.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was another one of the liked projects because it was fun to put
    whatever knowledge I had and combine it with a game that I enjoy playing. Thinking
    about the math behind each function and how to call on them were awesome to see.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part 1 was relatively enjoyable aswell. It was more towards the beginning, so it
    wasn't tough at all, but learning how to implement math functions into the code, and then
    being able to turn it into a what is essentially a POS at a restaurant was nice.
